"""Turn the AH Department office sheet into assets/vet_offices.json.

Source: "Offices of Dept of AH Gujarat State.xlsx" (Dept of Animal Husbandry,
Gujarat). Columns: Sr.No. | Office Name | Village | Taluka | District |
Category (English) | Office Type (Gujarati).

The sheet is a lookup table, not prose, so it is NOT indexed in Marqo — 3.2k
near-identical rows ("Veterinary Dispensary, <village>, <taluka>") embed to
almost the same vector and location matching is a filter, not a similarity. The
voice agent reads this JSON directly (agents/tools/vet_offices.py).

This script only transcribes. The sheet is the department's, not ours, so every
place name is carried across exactly as written — including the variant
spellings (Kutch/Kachchh, Dohad/Dahod, BHAVNAGAR) and the outright typos
(Vadpdara). Only surrounding whitespace is trimmed, which changes no name.
Treating those variants as the same place is a lookup-time decision and lives in
agents/tools/vet_offices.py, where it can be read and corrected without
rewriting the department's data.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_vet_offices.py "path/to/Offices of Dept of AH Gujarat State.xlsx"
