"""Standard OSS -> managed fallback for LLM pipelines.

See docs/oss-fallback-design.md. One mechanism, used by every unary pipeline
(pretranslation, moderation, suggestions): a resolved pipeline *variant* becomes
an ordered *attempt chain* — ``[oss, managed]`` for OSS sessions, ``[managed]``
otherwise — and ``execute_with_fallback`` walks it, classifying each failure,
falling back on infrastructure errors, and recording every failure for the
``oss_fallback`` metric.

Gated by ``settings.fallback_enabled`` (default off): when disabled, callers keep
their existing code path, so merging this changes nothing until it is flipped on.

Core-chat streaming uses ``stream_with_fallback`` (first-token commit): an OSS
failure *before* the first token swaps to managed transparently; once the first
token has reached the caller a swap is impossible, so the error propagates.
``with_first_token_deadline`` bounds time-to-first-token only (mid-stream tool
round-trips / slow generation are unaffected) by isolating the agent stream in its
own task + queue, so it stays disconnect-safe (see its docstring).
