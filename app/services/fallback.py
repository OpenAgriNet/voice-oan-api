"""Standard OSS -> managed fallback for LLM pipelines.

See docs/oss-fallback-design.md. One mechanism, used by every unary pipeline
(pretranslation, moderation, suggestions): a resolved pipeline *variant* becomes
an ordered *attempt chain* — ``[oss, managed]`` for OSS sessions, ``[managed]``
otherwise — and ``execute_with_fallback`` walks it, classifying each failure,
falling back on infrastructure errors, and recording every failure for the
``oss_fallback`` metric.

Gated by ``settings.fallback_enabled`` (default off): when disabled, callers keep
their existing code path, so merging this changes nothing until it is flipped on.

Core-chat streaming uses ``stream_with_fallback`` (first-token commit): an OSS
failure *before* the first token swaps to managed transparently; once the first
token has reached the caller a swap is impossible, so the error propagates.
``with_first_token_deadline`` bounds time-to-first-token only (mid-stream tool
round-trips / slow generation are unaffected) by isolating the agent stream in its
own task + queue, so it stays disconnect-safe (see its docstring).

    The agent stream (which carries pydantic-ai's ``run_stream`` anyio cancel
    scope) is driven entirely inside a dedicated task and forwarded chunk-by-chunk
    through a queue; only the first ``queue.get`` is bounded (``asyncio.wait_for``).
    This is deliberate: ``run_stream``'s cancel scope is opened, advanced AND closed
    within that one task, while the consumer only ever awaits a plain queue — so
    THIS generator can be ``aclose()``'d from another task (a client disconnect /
    mid-stream ``GeneratorExit``) without ever touching an anyio scope. An earlier
    version wrapped the stream in an ``anyio.move_on_after`` scope that spanned the
    ``yield``s; that crashed on every disconnect with "exit cancel scope in a
    different task" / "aclose: generator already running". Validated against real
    ``run_stream`` incl. the disconnect path.

    A pre-first-token timeout raises ``TimeoutError`` (``classify`` -> ``TIMEOUT``
    -> fallbackable, so ``stream_with_fallback`` swaps before any token reached the
    caller). Stream exceptions propagate unchanged. No-op when ``attempt.timeout``
    is None (fallback disabled).

    * Failure BEFORE the first chunk, on a fallbackable reason and not the last
