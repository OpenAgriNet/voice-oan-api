"""Outbound-call opening script (milk-details consent) for voice calls.

Raya stamps ``call_type=outbound`` on requests for calls WE placed. On the first
turn of such a call Sarlaben reads a fixed consent line; on the next turn the
farmer's reply is classified by :mod:`app.services.outbound_consent` into
affirmative / negative / other.

Everything caller-facing here is pinned Gujarati, served verbatim. It never goes
through TranslateGemma: these lines carry a phone number, the brand name, and the
farmer-facing framing of a data readout, all of which the translation sandwich has
historically drifted on.

State lives in Redis under the session (not in message history) so the stage
survives history trimming and so an inbound call can never accidentally read it.
