"""Sticky per-session pipeline-variant router (voice).

Routes a configurable percentage of voice sessions to the OSS pipeline
(vLLM gemma agent + vLLM gemma pretranslation; post-translation
TranslateGemma is unchanged regardless of variant) while the rest stay
on the legacy pipeline. The assignment is:

* deterministic   - bucketed from a stable hash of session_id, so the same
                     session always lands the same way even without Redis;
* sticky          - the resolved variant is persisted in the shared Redis
                     cache, so a session keeps its variant for its lifetime
                     even if OSS_PIPELINE_PCT is changed afterwards;
* shared          - all API instances read the same Redis state;
* fail-safe       - any Redis error degrades to the deterministic hash, never
                     raising into the request path. With OSS_PIPELINE_PCT=0 (or
                     OSS model unconfigured) every session resolves to
                     ``legacy`` and behaviour is identical to today.
