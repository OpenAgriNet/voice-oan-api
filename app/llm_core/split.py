"""P1: weighted named-profile split + config-driven attempt chain (voice repo).

This is the generalization of two hardwired pieces:

* ``pipeline_router._deterministic_variant`` — a *single* OSS/legacy bit from
  ``int(sha256(session_id)[:8], 16) % 100 < OSS_PIPELINE_PCT`` — becomes an
  assignment into one of *N* weighted :class:`NamedProfile` s via **cumulative
  weight buckets over the SAME hash**. Bit-compatible by construction: the shim's
  ``[oss(pct), managed(100-pct)]`` config puts the ``oss`` profile in buckets
  ``[0, pct)`` and ``managed`` in ``[pct, 100)`` — exactly today's
  ``bucket < pct -> oss`` boundary.

* ``fallback.attempt_chain``'s hardwired ``[oss, managed]`` — becomes the
  resolved profile's ``StepConfig.tiers`` materialized through the P0 factory
  (:func:`app.llm_core.factory.materialize`), preserving order (primary first).

Stickiness is the deterministic hash bucket itself — no Redis state. Same
``session_id`` + same weights -> same profile (stable within a config version);
a weight change re-maps the bucket so continuing sessions FOLLOW the new % on a
redeploy / config change rather than freezing on the old model. (voice
``pipeline_router`` pinned the profile name in Redis, which froze sessions across
weight changes — deliberately dropped: it defeats the refresh-on-change contract.)

Gated by ``PROFILES_ENABLED`` at the call seam (the fallback walkers via
``fallback._resolve_chain``); nothing here reads that flag — it is inert until a
caller invokes it. The P2 health-prune and P3 concurrency-reorder hooks are added
into :func:`resolve_chain` in their respective phases.
