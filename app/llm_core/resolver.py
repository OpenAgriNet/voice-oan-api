"""Resolver — the single seam the engine consumes (voice repo).

``resolve_chain(step, profile_name)`` selects the named profile DIRECTLY, looks up
the step's tiers (profile override, else defaults), and materializes them into
``list[MaterializedTier]`` (primary first, never empty).

The routing token is the actual profile NAME (the N-way split's output), selected
via ``pipeline.by_name(profile_name)`` with a fail-safe to ``managed`` then
``profiles[0]``. There is no longer a 2-way ``variant`` collapse: a 3rd profile
(e.g. ``qwen``) is served with ITS tiers, not bucketed back to oss/managed. An
absent/stale name resolves to ``managed`` — identical to the old variant mapping,
so threading ``"oss"``/``"legacy"`` remains bit-identical (``"legacy"`` -> managed).

Voice deviation from chat: ``MODERATION`` and ``NON_MEANINGFUL`` materialize to
the RAW_OPENAI client kind (voice moderation / non-meaningful are bare
``AsyncOpenAI`` calls, not pydantic-ai agents), and there is no ``SUGGESTIONS``
step.

    construction and let a misconfigured overflow tier take a healthy primary down.
