"""Resolver — the single seam the engine consumes (voice repo).

``resolve_chain(step, variant)`` selects the profile for a session's resolved
variant, looks up the step's tiers (profile override, else defaults), and
materializes them into ``list[MaterializedTier]`` (primary first, never empty).

P0 has **no weighted split yet**: the variant is resolved upstream exactly as
today (``pipeline_router.resolve_pipeline_variant``) and passed in; here we just
map ``variant -> profile`` ("oss" -> profile ``oss``, anything else -> ``managed``,
fail-safe to managed when the OSS profile is absent). The chain shape ([oss,
managed] for OSS, [managed] otherwise) matches ``fallback.attempt_chain`` so P1
can drop the weighted split + config-driven tiers in behind this same API.

Voice deviation from chat: ``MODERATION`` and ``NON_MEANINGFUL`` materialize to
the RAW_OPENAI client kind (voice moderation / non-meaningful are bare
``AsyncOpenAI`` calls, not pydantic-ai agents), and there is no ``SUGGESTIONS``
step.

    Post-translation is unique: TranslateGemma serves ~every turn, and its cheap
    :class:`TGDescriptor` primary is provider-independent, whereas the managed-LLM
    overflow tier is an ``AsyncOpenAI`` client that is both expensive to build and
    can legitimately fail to construct in a healthy-TG deployment (no OPENAI key,
    incomplete Azure env, unset INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_URL, anthropic/gemini provider).
    Eagerly materializing the whole chain on EVERY translate call would waste that
    construction and let a misconfigured overflow tier take a healthy primary down.
    So the translation adapter takes the tiers INERT and builds each handle LAZILY
    only as the fallback walker reaches it (see ``translation._PostTranslationTier``).

    Deliberately does NOT ``record_profile``: post-translation runs AFTER the agent
    step and is profile-INVARIANT (it lives in ``defaults``), so recording a profile
    here would last-write-wins CLOBBER the turn's real ``pipeline_profile`` (set by
    the agent-step ``resolve_chain``) to "managed". The step chain is still recorded
