"""The farmer context must not tell the agent to ask an unanswerable question.

A mobile is shared by a household. Of 364 real name pairs the agent offered,
250 share a name token and 19 are byte identical, so the caller answers and the
answer fits both records. 71 of the 265 calls in "AI booking not done" died in
that loop — the largest single remaining source of failed bookings (#282).

Whether the question is worth a turn depends on what differs: technicians come
from (unionCode, societyCode) alone, and 90% of multi-account mobiles have every
record in one society, where the visit is identical whichever is used.
