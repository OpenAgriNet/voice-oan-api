"""An upstream failure is not an answer, and must never be cached as one.

Issue #282 root cause B: 108 of 356 failing voice sessions had no fetch span at
all — they were served a cached empty envelope. Twenty-eight of those phones
booked successfully at other times, which proves those envelopes should never
have been written. The cause is that `fetch_farmer_amulpashudhan` returned None
for a 204, a non-200, a JSON error, a timeout AND a genuine "no such farmer",
so `refresh_farmer_data` wrote `not_found` and pinned it for the two-hour
FARMER_NEGATIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

The distinction matters to the caller, not just the cache: a cached `not_found`
tells a registered farmer their number is not registered, while an unresolved
lookup tells them to try again shortly.
