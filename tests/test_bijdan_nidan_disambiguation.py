"""બીજદાન (insemination) must not be translated as નિદાન (diagnosis).

ASR drops the જ and returns non-words (બિદાન, બિદદાન, વિદાન…). The nearest real
Gujarati word is નિદાન — one letter away, ન vs બ — so the translator picks
"diagnosis", which is why the agent answered about diagnosis while the farmer
was asking to book an insemination. Edit distance FAVOURS the wrong answer
(બિદાન→નિદાન is 1 edit, બિદાન→બીજદાન is 2), so no similarity-based rewrite can
fix this; the rule has to teach the distinction.

Replay of 88 real utterances from the 265 "AI booking not done" calls, through
the live pretranslation leg: 1/88 correct before, 88/88 after, with all 51 true
નિદાન controls unchanged. See issue #266.
