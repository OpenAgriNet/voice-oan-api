"""
Cache layer for farmer data fetched from PashuGPT APIs.

Voice reads farmer context from Redis only. Freshness is controlled separately
from key expiry:
- soft refresh interval: 12h for "found", 2h for "not_found"
- cache retention (hard delete): 7d

This lets the request path return cached data immediately, mark it stale in the
read result, and schedule a background refresh (via a Redis queue drained by a
worker) without blocking the caller.
