"""Whether the caller's farmer identity is resolved for this turn, and what
follows from that.

Voice used to render "no farmer record exists" and "we have not established
whether one exists" identically — as an empty farmer block — while still
offering every identity-taking tool. The model, handed a required `farmer_code`
slot and nothing to fill it from, invented one: `MISSING`, `UNKNOWN`, `F12345`,
`UNION_CODE_FROM_CONTEXT`, farmer names in `farmerCode`. Measured 2026-09-01..09-14
on voice-production: create_health_call 20.2%, create_ai_call 10.4%,
get_farmer_milk_collection_details 10.2%. Every observed failure ran on a prompt
with no farmer block, and no booking has ever succeeded from one.

This module is the ONE place that decides the state, because two consumers must
never disagree about it:

  * `prepare_requires_farmer_identity` removes the identity-taking tools from
    the schema the model sees, so inventing a code is not something it can do.
  * `unavailable_capability_lines` tells the model which capabilities are off
    this turn and why, so it says something true instead of "that feature does
    not exist" or, worse, claiming a booking it never made.

If those were computed separately they would drift, and a prompt that promises a
tool which is not in the schema is worse than either failure alone.

See issue #282.
