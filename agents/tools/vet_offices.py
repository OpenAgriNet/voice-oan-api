"""Nearest government veterinary office lookup, from the AH Department sheet.

Deliberately not a Marqo index. The source is a 3.2k-row lookup table whose rows
read almost identically ("Veterinary Dispensary, <village>, <taluka>"), so they
embed to nearly the same vector, and "nearest" is a filter over village/taluka,
not a semantic similarity. It is a flat JSON asset plus this tool instead — see
scripts/build_vet_offices.py for how the asset is produced.

Location comes from the caller's profile (FarmerContext), not from the model.
The sheet is keyed on taluka, which the profile does not carry, so when village
and district are not enough the tool asks for the taluka name by voice and
matches it as text — there are no coordinates in the sheet to measure with.

The asset is a faithful transcription: the department's spellings, variants and
typos are all carried across untouched. Every judgement about which of them mean
the same place is made here instead, so the data stays theirs and the reading of
it stays ours, in one file that can be corrected without a re-import.
