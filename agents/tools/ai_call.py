    Book an artificial insemination (beech daan / બીજ દાન) call for a farmer.
    Extract union_code, society_code, farmer_code, and the selected AI technician user_id
    from the farmer context in the system prompt.
    If these details are not available, tell the farmer their details are not available right now.
    Ask the farmer whether the booking is for a cow (ગાય) or buffalo (ભેંસ) before calling this tool.
    Never ask the farmer to speak an internal technician ID. Use the selected technician option
    already present in farmer context.
    If Farmer Profile says AI call booking is not allowed for this union, tell the farmer
    exactly: Kindly contact your Milk Society to book the service. Do not ask which
    technician and do not book.

    Args:
        ctx: The run context (automatically provided).
        union_code: Union code for the farmer from farmer context.
        society_code: Society code for the farmer from farmer context.
        farmer_code: Farmer code for the farmer from farmer context.
        user_id: Selected AI technician user ID mapped from farmer context.
        species: Species to book the AI call for. Use `cow` or `buffalo`.
